    "    <li><b>main</b> - This module contains the main method of the program. It initializes the server, the clients, establishes a counter for the amount of messages sent and the time elapsed since the server started. It then begins a loop that will send off 20 messages over a period of time. Every 4 seconds, each message sent to the server will be processed into a CSV file and will be printed in the terminal. Once 20 messages have been sent, the program will finish executing.</li>\n",
